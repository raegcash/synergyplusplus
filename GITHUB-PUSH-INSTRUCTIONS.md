## 🔐 How to Push (Choose One Method)

### **Method 1: Using Personal Access Token (Recommended)**

1. **Create a Personal Access Token on GitHub:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Give it a name: "Synergy++ Push"
   - Select scopes: ✅ `repo` (all repo access)
   - Click "Generate token"
   - **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)

2. **Push using the token:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/raemarvin.pangilinan/Desktop/Synergy++/superapp-ecosystem
   
   # When prompted for username: enter your GitHub username
   # When prompted for password: paste the personal access token
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Optional - Save credentials:**
   ```bash
   # This saves your credentials so you don't need to enter them every time
   git config credential.helper store
   git push -u origin main
   ```

---

### **Method 2: Using SSH (Alternative)**

1. **Check if you have SSH keys:**
   ```bash
   ls -la ~/.ssh
   # Look for id_rsa.pub or id_ed25519.pub
   ```

2. **If you don't have SSH keys, create them:**
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"
   # Press Enter to accept defaults
   ```

3. **Copy your public key:**
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   # Copy the output
   ```

4. **Add SSH key to GitHub:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/keys
   - Click "New SSH key"
   - Paste your public key
   - Click "Add SSH key"

5. **Change remote URL to SSH:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/raemarvin.pangilinan/Desktop/Synergy++/superapp-ecosystem
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:raegcash/synergy-.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

---

### **Method 3: GitHub Desktop (Easiest)**

1. Download GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/
2. Sign in to GitHub
3. File → Add Local Repository → Select the `superapp-ecosystem` folder
4. Click "Push origin"

---

## 🎯 Quick Push (If You Have Credentials)

If you already have GitHub credentials configured:

```bash
cd /Users/raemarvin.pangilinan/Desktop/Synergy++/superapp-ecosystem
git push -u origin main
```

## ✅ After Successful Push

Once pushed, your code will be available at:
**https://github.com/raegcash/synergy-.git**

You can verify by visiting:
- Repository: https://github.com/raegcash/synergy-
- Check the commit history
- Review the files

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed"
- Make sure you're using a **Personal Access Token**, not your password
- GitHub no longer accepts passwords for git operations

### "Permission denied"
- Check that your token has `repo` scope
- Verify you have write access to the repository

### "Repository not found"
- Make sure the repository exists: https://github.com/raegcash/synergy-
- Check that you have access to it

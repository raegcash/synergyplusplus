# 🏗️ Composable Super App Ecosystem - Architecture Overview

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: October 13, 2025

---

## 🎯 Vision: Marketplace Orchestrator

This is not just a FinTech app - it's a **Marketplace Orchestrator** providing:
- **Marketplace of Financial Products** (Investments, Lending, Savings, Insurance)
- **Marketplace of Companies** (Multiple partners offering products)
- **Marketplace of Offerings** (Specific products from each company)

---

## 📐 Architecture Principles

### 1. **Domain-Driven Composability**
- Services are **Packaged Business Capabilities (PBCs)**
- Each PBC is "small enough to maximize business agility, but large enough to contain integrity"
- PBCs are the **products** in the marketplace

### 2. **API-First Design**
- Every function exposed through secure, well-documented APIs
- Enables seamless internal integration and external partner collaboration

### 3. **Microservices-Driven**
- Independent services that evolve rapidly
- Scale without monolithic constraints

### 4. **Cloud-Native & Headless**
- High availability and resilience
- Consistent experience across all touchpoints

### 5. **Zero Trust Security**
- No implicit trust based on network location
- Every PBC-to-PBC interaction verified

## 🏛️ Service Layers

### **Layer 1: Core Foundation Services (Operational Utilities)**

These are **generic**, **reusable** services consumed by ALL verticals:

| Service | Purpose | Database | Key Features |
|---------|---------|----------|--------------|
| **Identity Service** | User verification, KYC, multi-tenant identity | PostgreSQL | OAuth2, JWT, KYC workflows, multi-factor auth |
| **Ledger Service** | Real-time transaction ledger, balances | PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB | Double-entry accounting, real-time balance updates, CQRS |
| **Payment Rail Engine** | Universal payment processing | PostgreSQL | Multi-currency, multiple payment providers (ACL), settlement |
| **Risk Monitor Service** | Real-time fraud detection | PostgreSQL + Redis | Event-driven fraud detection, risk scoring, alerting |

**Design Mandate**: These services MUST be agnostic to the business domain. They don't know about "investments" or "lending" - they only know about users, transactions, payments, and risk.

---

### **Layer 2: Financial Product PBCs (The Super App Features)**

These are the **actual financial services** that users consume:

| Service | Purpose | Database | Key Features |
|---------|---------|----------|--------------|
| **Investment Service** | Social trading, portfolio management | PostgreSQL | Copy trading, portfolio analytics, real-time market data, social feed |
| **Lending Service** | Loan origination, credit scoring | PostgreSQL | Loan applications, credit assessment, repayment schedules, collections |
| **Savings Service** | Digital wallet, savings accounts | PostgreSQL | High-yield savings, round-ups, goal-based saving, instant withdrawals |
| **Insurance Broker Service** | Partner integration for insurance | PostgreSQL | Policy aggregation, quote comparison, partner API integration (ACL) |

**Design Mandate**: These services use the Core Foundation Services. They integrate with external partners via **Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL)**.

---

### **Layer 3: Marketplace Services (Orchestration)**

These services enable the **marketplace model**:

| Service | Purpose | Database | Key Features |
|---------|---------|----------|--------------|
| **Product Catalog Service** | Manage all products & offerings | PostgreSQL | Product registry, categories, pricing, availability, feature flags |
| **Partner Management Service** | Onboard & manage partners | PostgreSQL | **Integrated Hypercare**, partner onboarding, SLA monitoring, revenue share |

**Design Mandate**: Partner Management Service **includes** hypercare capabilities:
- Product feature toggles
- Maintenance mode
- Greylist (user access control)
- Partner-specific configurations

---

### **Layer 4: BFF (Backend for Frontend)**

API Gateways that aggregate services for specific frontends:

| BFF | Purpose | Aggregates |
|-----|---------|------------|
| **Admin BFF** | Partner management, operations | Partner Mgmt, Product Catalog, all product services |
| **Client BFF** | User-facing marketplace | Product Catalog, Investment, Lending, Savings, Insurance, Identity |

**Design Mandate**: BFFs handle:
- Request aggregation
- Response transformation
- Authentication/Session management
- Caching
- Rate limiting

---

### **Layer 5: Frontend Applications**

| App | Purpose | Users |
|-----|---------|-------|
| **Admin Portal** | Partner management + integrated hypercare | Platform admins, partner managers |
| **Client Super App** | Unified marketplace experience | End users (investors, borrowers, savers) |

---

## 🔄 Key Architectural Patterns

### **1. Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**
- **Message Broker**: Apache Kafka
- **Use Cases**: 
  - Real-time balance updates (Ledger → Investment/Savings)
  - Fraud detection (all transactions → Risk Monitor)
  - Audit logging (all events → Audit Service)

### **2. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**
- **Command Model**: Write operations (trades, deposits, loans)
- **Query Model**: Read operations (dashboards, reports, analytics)
- **Applied In**: Ledger Service, Investment Service

### **3. Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL)**
- **Purpose**: Isolate internal PBCs from external/legacy systems
- **Location**: `shared-libs/acl-adapters/`
- **Examples**:
  - BaaS Provider ACL (Galileo, Marqeta, Synapse)
  - Market Data Provider ACL (Alpha Vantage, IEX)
  - Credit Bureau ACL (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion)

### **4. Multi-Tenancy & Data Isolation**
- **Strategy**: Sharding + partitioning
- **Authorization**: Granular, role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Enforcement**: At Identity Service + API Gateway level

---

## 🔐 Security Architecture

### **Zero Trust Model**
1. **No implicit trust** - Every service-to-service call verified
2. **JWT-based authentication** - Issued by Identity Service
3. **Service mesh** - Istio for mTLS between services
4. **API Gateway** - Rate limiting, DDoS protection, WAF

### **Data Protection**
- **Encryption at rest**: PostgreSQL TDE (Transparent Data Encryption)
- **Encryption in transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **PII handling**: Tokenization for sensitive data
- **GDPR compliance**: Data minimization, right to erasure, purpose limitation

## 📊 Data Flow Example: Investment Trade

```
User (Client App)
  ↓ POST /api/trades
Client BFF
  ↓ Authenticate (Identity Service)
  ↓ Check risk limits (Risk Monitor Service)
Investment Service
  ↓ Create trade order
  ↓ Publish TradeInitiated event → Kafka
Ledger Service (subscribes to TradeInitiated)
  ↓ Lock funds
  ↓ Create pending transaction
Payment Rail Engine (subscribes to TradeInitiated)
  ↓ Execute payment to broker
  ↓ Publish PaymentExecuted event → Kafka
Ledger Service (subscribes to PaymentExecuted)
  ↓ Commit transaction
  ↓ Update user balance
  ↓ Publish BalanceUpdated event → Kafka
Investment Service (subscribes to BalanceUpdated)
  ↓ Update portfolio
  ↓ Notify user
```
